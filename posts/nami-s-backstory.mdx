Nami is one of the main characters of the popular manga and anime series One Piece. She is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates, a group of adventurers who seek to find the legendary treasure One Piece and fulfill their dreams. Nami's dream is to draw a map of the entire world, a goal that was inspired by her tragic backstory.

Nami was born in Oykot Kingdom, a peaceful island that was invaded by the Arlong Pirates, a crew of fish-men who oppressed and exploited the human inhabitants. Nami's parents were killed by the invaders, and she was adopted by a marine officer named Bell-mère, who also took in another orphan girl named Nojiko. Nami grew up in Cocoyasi Village, where she learned to navigate and draw maps from a young age.

When <a href="https://fanime.site/waifu-collection-008-showcasing-supreme-anime-character-fanart-of-nami/">Nami</a> was eight years old, Arlong discovered her talent for cartography and forced her to join his crew as his mapmaker. He also demanded a ransom of 100 million berries from Cocoyasi Village, threatening to destroy it if they failed to pay. Bell-mère sacrificed her life to protect Nami and Nojiko from Arlong's wrath, leaving Nami with a deep hatred for pirates and a scar on her shoulder.

Nami made a deal with Arlong: if she could raise 100 million berries by herself, he would free her and her village from his tyranny. Nami spent the next eight years stealing money from pirates and other sources, while secretly working on her own map of the world. She also pretended to be loyal to Arlong, earning the distrust and resentment of her fellow villagers.

Nami's life changed when she met Monkey D. Luffy, the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, who came to her island in search of a navigator. Luffy was impressed by Nami's skills and personality, and offered her to join his crew. Nami initially refused, but later agreed to work with him temporarily after he helped her escape from Buggy the Clown, another pirate who tried to kill her.

Luffy soon learned about Nami's situation and decided to help her free her village from Arlong. He fought against Arlong and his crew, along with his friends Roronoa Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji. They also gained the support of the villagers, who realized that Nami was actually their ally. Luffy defeated Arlong with his signature move, Gum-Gum Jet Bazooka, and destroyed his headquarters. He then gave Nami his straw hat, a symbol of his friendship and trust, and asked her to join his crew again.

Nami accepted Luffy's offer and became the official navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates. She also received a tattoo on her arm that covered her scar and represented her new family: a tangerine (Bell-mère's favorite fruit) and a pinwheel (Genzo's trademark accessory). Nami's backstory shaped her personality and motivations in many ways. She became independent, resourceful, intelligent, and brave. She also developed a love for money and treasure, as well as a fear of fish-men and sea monsters. She is loyal to her friends and grateful for their help. She is determined to achieve her dream of mapping the world and seeing its wonders.
