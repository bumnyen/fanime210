<h2>What is a Demon Slayer Mark?</h2>
<p><a class="tooltip-target" href="https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Mark" target="_blank" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-5-group">According to the Kimetsu no Yaiba Wiki</a>, a Demon Slayer Mark is &ldquo;a mysterious marking that Demon Slayers can awaken under specific conditions&rdquo;. It usually appears on the face or another visible location of the body, and it resembles the crest of a demon. Each Demon Slayer has a unique pattern to their Mark, which is based on the Breathing Style they use.</p>
<p>The Demon Slayer Mark grants special abilities and enhances the pre-existing traits of the bearer, such as speed, strength, endurance, reflexes, perception and concentration. However, it can also disappear after a period of time, along with its effects. To activate or maintain the Mark, one has to meet certain criteria or train hard.</p>
<h2>How does one awaken a Demon Slayer Mark?</h2>
<p>The Demon Slayer Mark is not something that anyone can easily obtain.&nbsp;<a class="tooltip-target" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-10-group">It requires surviving extremely life-threatening conditions, such as having a heart rate of over 200 beats per minute and a body temperature of over 39&deg;C (102.2&deg;F)</a>. These conditions can be fatal for most people, but some Demon Slayers are able to withstand them and go beyond their limits.</p>
<p>However, there is another important prerequisite for awakening the Mark: being in contact with someone who already has it, or has had it before. Without this condition, the Mark cannot be awakened at all.&nbsp;<a class="tooltip-target" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-13-group">This means that the Mark can spread from one bearer to another, as if they were resonating with each other</a><a class="ac-anchor sup-target" href="https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Mark" target="_blank" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-13"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>What is the origin of the Demon Slayer Mark?</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AJFCJaUYYb1ik38u_VSnp9PF5HlNhsu9qCI7DApodU8acY3yU4q-f_YATldiEmvKchXQKdtgVL65DVUPDP2vVU9moVUsh6phkGTAoHqqjOHNRvEAFy73YJ7w_EZl-clbInFseXihqPZf89qsp8iNbmiGLgg3=w662-h880-s-no?authuser=0" alt="" width="662" height="880" /></p>
<p>The Demon Slayer Mark has a long history that dates back to the Sengoku Era, about 500 years before the current timeline of the series.&nbsp;<a class="tooltip-target" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-17-group">This was known as the Golden Age of Demon Slayers, when the progenitors of the first ever Breathing Styles all manifested markings on their bodies</a>. These were later known as Demon Slayer Marks.</p>
<p>The progenitor of the Mark was Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the strongest Demon Slayer in existence and the creator of Breathing Styles.&nbsp;<a class="tooltip-target" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-20-group">He was born with a Demon Slayer Mark, which means he never had to undergo special training to awaken it</a>. He was also able to use the Sun Breathing Technique, which is considered to be the original and most powerful Breathing Style.</p>
<h2>What is the curse of the Demon Slayer Mark?</h2>
<p>The Demon Slayer Mark may seem like a great advantage for fighting against demons, but it also comes with a terrible curse.&nbsp;<a class="tooltip-target" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-24-group">The curse is that anyone who awakens the Mark will die before they reach 25 years old</a>. This means that they will have a very short lifespan, regardless of how strong they are.</p>
<p><a class="tooltip-target" data-citationid="b527ed5c-b6ed-f077-a26a-bf706cb230aa-27-group">One possible explanation for the curse is that the exponential increase in power that the bearer experiences upon awakening their Mark takes a heavy toll on their body, resulting in a decreased lifespan</a>. This is supported by Shinobu Kocho&rsquo;s remark that the conditions for awakening the Mark are harmful to the body.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is that the curse is actually a form of protection from Muzan Kibutsuji, the first and most powerful demon. Muzan fears anyone who can use the Sun Breathing Technique, as it is the only thing that can kill him. Therefore, he may have placed a curse on anyone who awakens the Mark, which is related to the Sun Breathing Technique, to prevent them from becoming a threat to him.</p>
<h2>Who are some of the characters with a Demon Slayer Mark?</h2>
<p>There are not many characters in the series who have awakened or possessed a <a href="https://fanime.blog/demon-slayer-the-mystery-of-the-demon-slayer-mark-and-its-red-color/">Demon Slayer Mark</a>. Some of them are:</p>
